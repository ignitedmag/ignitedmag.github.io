                    The first issue of IGNITED - The Bubble Issue - delves into the subject of Algorithms and the effect Bubble Filters have on society, culture and on ourselves individually. <br><br>
                        The concept of Bubble Vision, coined by Hito Steyerl, renowned filmmaker and writer, was the starting point of this first issue. However, from conclusions drafted from Steyerl’s lectures on this matter, it was quickly understood that this notion ought to actually be the finish line of this whole endeavor. <br><br>
                        Bubble Vision as a concept has its roots on the ability of simulating reality. Steyerl describes the idea of reality as format as a consequence of the biosphere experiments held in the 90’s, namely the Biosphere project (1991-1994), meant to explore the limits of human condition and its capability of self-sufficiency in a man-made ecosystem built inside a large spherical structure — a “bubble”.<br><br>
                        Subsequently, Steyerl utilizes these experiments, and their intrinsic notions and ideas, as manner to try to demonstrate and extrapolate a transition that is happening presently: the end of the Anthropocene — a proposed geological epoch marked by human influence on planet earth — due to the rise of Algorithms. These invisible mechanisms, present in every aspect of our lives, already have the power of infiltrating our reality by shaping and molding every aspect of our lives and will, as it is anticipated, grow increasingly in power in the near future.<br><br>
                        These mathematical formulas began to designate, execute, interrupt and modify actions upon actions in infinite and uncontrolled loops: ghosts that have replaced humans in the execution of tasks of larger dimensions, working in increasingly abstract and unintelligible ways.<br><br>
                        Therefore, the Algorithms are the unity of the Filter Bubble, together they make up the membrane of the bubble we live in. We can’t neither see or feel them, but they are actively and radically changing the way we see the world, and as a result the way our culture is built.<br><br>
                        Their action is particularly witnessed in social media — now the go-to place for social interactions, entertainment and accessing news — all that we read, watch and consume is filtered by algorithms.<br><br>
                        As these algorithms curate our feeds, they narrow the notion of reality of the individuals that use them, creating the aforementioned filter bubble. Consequently, they cause the development of a bubble vision, which in turn leads to the multiplication and propagation of these algorithmic identities. <br><br>
                        If we live in a paradigm in which our culture is made up of what we digest visually, and if algorithms control our “cultural diet”, then we are before the emergence of an algorithmic culture.
